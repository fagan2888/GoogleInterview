# Algorithms
- Algorithms are a sequence of unambiguous instructions to solve a problem. Get output from a relevant set of inputs in finite amount of time.
#### Von Neumann Machine
The essence of this architecture is captured by the so-called random-access machine (RAM).Its central assumption is that instructions are executed one after another, one operation at a time. Accordingly, algorithms designed to be executed on such machines are called sequential algorithms.
#### Algorithm Design Techique
An algorithm design technique (or “strategy” or “paradigm”) is a general approach to solving problems algorithmically that is applicable to a variety of problems from different areas of computing.
